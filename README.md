## Description 
### Purpose 
The primary goal of this project was to develop a static e-commerce website hosted entirely on AWS, offering users a comprehensive shopping experience. The website allows users to browse products, search for items, view individual product pages, add items to their cart, and securely complete their purchases through a streamlined checkout process. Additionally, users have the option to create accounts, log in securely. For any inquiries or requests, users can conveniently contact the store via a contact form integrated into the website.
